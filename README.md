# What is the Fragile X Syndrome?
Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked genetic disease caused by a mutation in the FMR-1gene. It is a change in the DNA sequence that causes the absence of a protein called FMRP1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein). This protein is essential for normal brain development, which explains the problems in the development of people affected by this syndrome.

The name of the syndrome is due to the fact that this mutation causes a small break in one of the arms of the X chromosome known as the fragile site. This breakage is only apparent when the chromosome is treated under specific conditions in the laboratory.

## Causes of Fragile X Syndrome

This genetic disease is caused by a mutation in the FMR-1 gene sequence. This change causes the protein for which this gene codes(FMRP1) is not produced and does not perform its function.

Within the FMR-1 gene there is a specific segment characterized by the repetition of a specific genetic sequence: the CGG trinucleotide. This sequence is present between 5 and 40 times in people not affected by Fragile X syndrome.
